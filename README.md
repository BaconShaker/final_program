    	A bunch of stuff shoud whiz by on the Terminal screen...

    Everything should be installed...
    	See if MAMP works.
    	Quit MAMP
    	Run the program (by double clicking CRES.command)
    		Everything should work! 
    		Or it won't and you'll see something like "Access Denied"
    			That's not what we want so go back to Terminal..
    				cd ~/GoogleDrive/all_in_one
    				chmod 755 CRES.command
    		Now everything should be running smoothly..?
